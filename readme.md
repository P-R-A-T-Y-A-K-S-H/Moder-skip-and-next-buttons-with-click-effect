Hi , we are creating the buttons - 

There are 3 files for a button one file declare how button will look when enabled second one declares how it will look when clicked and the third one helps to put these 2 files together

NOTE : in activity_main.xml correct the context property to the name of your activity having this layout if you face any errors .
